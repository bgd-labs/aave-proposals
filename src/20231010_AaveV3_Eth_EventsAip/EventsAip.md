## Simple Summary

This publication proposes the creation and funding of the Aave DAO budget allocation on events at DevConnect, rAAVE, and ETHGlobal Istanbul that help spread adoption and awareness of the Aave Protocol, GHO, and the Aave ecosystem.

## Motivation

We are proposing several thoughtful, well-organized and targeted events at DevConnect, including hackathons, booth presence, rAAVE and smaller side events that bring the broader community together. These initiatives will serve multiple purposes:

- Creating welcoming, engaging, and memorable experiences at the Aave booth.
- Sponsoring side events, hackathons, prizes and providing exceptional support to developers.
- Spreading Aaveâ€™s culture by distributing highly coveted merchandise.
- Selectively hosting rAAVEs to bring the Aave community together, reward contributors and make Aave the top ecosystem in crypto.
- Developing GHO Pass payment portal to showcase the power and utility of GHO.

## Specification

This proposal encompasses the following actions:

- Transfer 550,000 GHO to receiver address
