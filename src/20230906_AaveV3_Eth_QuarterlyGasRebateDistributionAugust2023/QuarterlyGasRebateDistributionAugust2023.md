## Simple Summary

This AIP proposes the quarterly gas rebate distribution for recognized delegates. The distribution aims to reimburse the gas costs incurred by delegates during their participation in Aave governance.

## Motivation

Recognized delegates play a crucial role in Aave governance by actively participating in proposal discussions, voting, and other governance activities. These activities often involve gas costs, especially when interacting with the Ethereum network. The Aave community established a quarterly gas rebate distribution to incentivize and support their continued participation.

## Specification

The following table provides a breakdown of the total gas used by each recognized delegate and the corresponding ETH amount to be distributed:

| Name           | Total Gas Spent |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| ACI            | 1.35            |
| HKTrust        | 0.07            |
| TokenLogic     | 0.50            |
| michigan       | 0.11            |
| LBS Blockchain | 0.18            |
| Wintermute     | 0.15            |
| keyrock        | 0.14            |
| Stablelab      | 0.20            |
| **Total ETH**  | **2.7 ETH**     |
