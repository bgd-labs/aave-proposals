## Summary

Gauntlet recommends lowering stMATIC, MaticX non-emode LT/LTV on Polygon v3 to improve the risk profile associated with MATIC LSTs.

Reducing MATIC LST non-emode LT to lower borrowing power can help combat the following.

- Risks of reduced WMATIC supply in the future, which may cause long-term growth risk for Polygon v3
- Risks of reduced capacity for recursive LST - WMATIC borrowing
- Risks associated with increased stablecoin borrowing against LST collateral, amidst decreasing MATIC LST liquidity

## Specification

| Chain   | Asset   | Action              | Current Value | New Value |
| ------- | ------- | ------------------- | ------------- | --------- |
| Polygon | stMATIC | Lower non-emode LT  | 65%           | 60%       |
| Polygon | stMATIC | Lower non-emode LTV | 50%           | 45%       |
| Polygon | MaticX  | Lower non-emode LT  | 67%           | 62%       |
| Polygon | MaticX  | Lower non-emode LTV | 58%           | 45%       |
