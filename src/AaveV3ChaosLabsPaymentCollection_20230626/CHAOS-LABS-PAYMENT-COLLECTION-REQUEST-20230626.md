# Summary

Chaos Labs requests the collection of a $350,000 delivery-based payment, as approved by the DAO in our service provider [proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/updated-proposal-chaos-labs-risk-simulation-platform/10025).

# Motivation

The payment structure for Chaos’ initial engagement with Aave, starting in November 2022, amounts to a total of $850,000, divided into:

- $500,000 base fee, paid in USDC and streamed linearly over the course of the contract
- $350,000, to be paid in AAVE tokens and contingent on the delivery of Chaos’ products:
  - $175,000 paid in AAVE tokens payable upon delivery of the Aave Parameter Recommendations Tools (7-day TWAP)
  - $175,000 paid in AAVE tokens payable upon delivery of the Aave Asset Listing Portal (7-day TWAP)

Upon completion and delivery of these deliverables, and in consideration of our ongoing work and services rendered to the DAO, we kindly request the delivery of the delivery-based payment.

# Specification

A one-time transfer amounting to 6,541 $AAVE ($350,000 using 7-day TWAP, $53.50, calculated on 06.23.2023) will be made to a Chaos Labs-controlled account (0xbC540e0729B732fb14afA240aA5A047aE9ba7dF0) as the recipient.

In terms of technical implementation, the AIP will call the transfer()method of the IAaveEcosystemReserveController interface to create a payment of 6,541 $AAVE.
