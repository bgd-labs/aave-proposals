## Simple Summary

This AIP proposes the inclusion of TokenLogic in the "Orbit" delegate platform initiative for a period of 90 days, with a monthly compensation of 5k GHO and total budget of 15k GHO.

## Motivation

TokenLogic has been an active and valuable participant in the Aave ecosystem. While they were initially eligible and considered for the Orbit program, they opted to explore the possibility of becoming a service provider to the DAO. However, given their recent decision to re-organize internally and re-evaluate their proposed scope as a service provider, it's appropriate to reconsider their inclusion in the Orbit program.

## Specification

### TokenLogic Inclusion

- TokenLogic will be recognized as an official delegate within the Orbit program for a period of 90 days.
- They will receive a monthly compensation of 5k GHO, totaling 15k GHO over the three-month period.

### Funding and Emissions

TokenLogic's compensation will be in line with the Orbit program's guidelines, ensuring fairness and consistency with other delegates.

### Responsibilities and Conditions

- TokenLogic will actively participate in Aave governance, representing their delegators and contributing to the protocol's growth.
- If TokenLogic presents and successfully passes a proposal to become a service provider to the DAO, their Orbit funding stream will be terminated to prevent double compensation.
